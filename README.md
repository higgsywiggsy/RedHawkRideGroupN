# RedHawkRideGroupN
This is the group project for CS445

# Project summary

The project we are working on is called RedhawkRide which is simply put, a ridesharing service that allows students in a hurry to get rides around campus which are fulfilled by other students. Students who drive for RedhawkRide can make money in their free time by completing rides, and students who take rides using the app enjoy the convenience of a quick trip from point A to point B. This project will calculate payments and charge the credit cards of students after their ride if they are to accept the ride. Our goal is to pay the drivers and provide great service to the customers through our app.
